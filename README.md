### Overview

Common interaction net intermediate represention which can be easily extended.

Designed to interface between higher-level languages & interaction net compiler backends.

This Haskell package defines canonical data types for this intermediate representation,
which can be exported to a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) v4-compatible schema
document for validation in [various languages](https://json-schema.org/obsolete-implementations).
